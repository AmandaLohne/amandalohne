            Purpose - why did I do it?
        </h2>

        <p>
            I wanted to display my plants. Make them a part of the interior of the apartment. Hopefully give them more light
            simultaneous. Wanted to learn more about the 3D-printing process. Learn more about how to use Fusion 360. 
            I got the inspiration from the internet. Just be searching "climbing plant support" you get several different ideas
            of how to make your plant climb up a wall. I fell in love with the idea to make a clip that looks like a leaf, so it
            is not so easy to spot the support mechanism. The "picture idea" I found on the internet had green filament leafs with 
            midrib and veins on the top part of the clip. I thought it would be an relative easy get-to-know-how-things-work task to 
            find inspiration (a design), make it similar to it and figure self how to cadde it, and in this case how the closing
            mechanism works.

            Experimental - how did I do it?

                <p>I am a person hwo like to jump into stuff and not nessecery do so much reasurch first. So I started by having 
                    some fun with the software, Fusion 360. Pressed on the different buttons, tryed to rotate the working space,
                    how to save the document and so on. After I felt comfortable, I started to outline the leaf. I desided the
                    size and dimensions after how I thought it would look good. I desided that the leaf should be divided in two, one top 
                    and one bottom. This would make it easier to design, in thought of the hole to the plant, but also easier to print.
                    After that was done I started to think and experiment with how the closing mechanism would work. The first idea I came 
                    up with was that the bottom part would have to equal sized holes and the top would have to tips that would fit 
                    the holes in the bottom perfekt. After I printed it and the closing mechanism was to loose and didnt close
                    properly, I named this design "try 1", and started on a new way to design the closing mechanism.
